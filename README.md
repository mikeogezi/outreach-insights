# Team Arrow KadHack 2018

Team Arrow's solution focuses on the health sector.
A basic tenet of economics is that resources are limited whilst human needs are basically infinite. In a country like Nigeria, this holds especially true. It would be beneficial for health agencies and organizations in the country to have a solution that would guide them to how to best impact the lives of people in rural communities in the most efficient way possible. Simply said, our solution aim to help doctors, nurses and other volunteers help the most peopl they can even with their limited budgets.

Our solution makes use of datasets and APIs from Grid3 Nigeria, Google, and Wikipedia.
